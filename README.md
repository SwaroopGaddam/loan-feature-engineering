# loan-feature-engineering
This project focuses on feature engineering to create a new feature called "Able to Pay", which helps assess a customer's likelihood of repaying their loan. Since existing features do not provide enough direct evidence to determine loan status, this feature is designed to improve loan risk assessment.
